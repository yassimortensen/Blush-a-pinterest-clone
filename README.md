# Welcome to Blush!

Blush is a WebApp that makes it easy to find new, professional images to inspire you. The app allows users to:
  - Be greeted with a masonry layout of beautiful photos
  - The ability to zoom in on each individual photo
  - See their own boards of saved images, categorized by type
  - Search for other users and see their saved boards of images

This Blush API is seeded with images from the Unsplash database. See their documentation to create your own token to seed your own local db.
